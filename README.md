# Flappy-geon

**Flappy-geon** (flappy pigeon) is a small flapping game made in [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/fr/) where you play as a pigeon flying his way through a futuristic city where breadcrumbs are nowhere to be found :(

The game features a beautiful pixel-art retro aesthetic with vibrant colors, faithful to the Game Boy Color era with a simple yet effective visual language.

As for the gameplay loop, it's everything you would expect from a clone of the classic IOS game, no more, no less.
